MY DOTFILES
========

#### Vim

Vim is my favorite text editor. This repo has the custom mappings, plugins etc I use, still making it more productive. This a [post i wrote about Vim](http://vysakh0.github.io/learning-vim-steering-hacking/)

##### Sneak peak

*vim*

 - vimrc (has all the custom settings and configuration)
 - auto_config.vim (all the configuration settings related to specific file extensions)
 - bundles.vim (all the plugins that can be installed using vundle plugin)
 - plugin_config.vim (plugin configuration, mappings)

#### Zsh

I have used very less of my own customization(except for zsh/aliases.zsh) and used oh-my-zsh, its plugin. This is a small post I wrote about [zsh](vysakh0.github.io/flying-start-with-zsh-shell/)

##### Sneak peak

*zsh*

- zshrc (plugins of oh-my-zsh that i use)
- aliases.zsh (aliases that are not in oh-my-zsh, but suitable to workflow)
