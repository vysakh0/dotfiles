This repo consits of zsh, vim, tmux related configurations.

#### Zsh

I have used very less of my own customization(except for zsh/aliases.zsh) and used oh-my-zsh, its plugin. This is a small post I wrote about [zsh](vysakh0.github.io/flying-start-with-zsh-shell/)

#### Vim

Vim is my favorite text editor. This repo has the custom mappings, plugins etc I used, still making it more productive. This a [post i wrote about Vim](http://vysakh0.github.io/learning-vim-steering-hacking/)
